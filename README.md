# CodeAlpha Task 1 – Iris Flower Classification 

This project is completed as **Task 1 of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.  
The objective of this project is to build a **machine learning classification model** that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its measurements.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The Iris Flower Classification project uses the famous **Iris dataset**, which contains measurements of iris flowers:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Based on these features, the model classifies the flower into one of the following species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

- Train-Test Split
- Classification Model Training
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy Score)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization, if used)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris Flower Dataset**, which is publicly available and also directly accessible using **Scikit-learn**.

---

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. Imported necessary libraries  
2. Loaded the Iris dataset  
3. Split the data into training and testing sets  
4. Trained a machine learning classification model  
5. Evaluated the model using accuracy score  
6. Predicted flower species based on input features

## ✅ Model Evaluation

The model performance was evaluated using test data, and accuracy was calculated to measure how well the model classifies Iris flower species.

---

## 📌 Result

The trained model successfully classifies Iris flowers into their respective species with good accuracy, demonstrating basic classification concepts in machine learning.
