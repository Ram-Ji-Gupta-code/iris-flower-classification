CodeAlpha Task 2 – Unemployment Analysis with Python

This project is completed as Task 2 of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The objective is to analyze the unemployment rate using Python, focusing on the impact of various factors like the COVID-19 pandemic across different regions.

📊 Project Overview

The Unemployment Analysis project uses a dataset that represents the unemployment percentage in India. It includes key metrics such as:
Region: The state or area being analyzed.
Date: The timeline of the data collection.
Estimated Unemployment Rate (%): The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.
Estimated Employed: The number of people currently working.
Estimated Labour Participation Rate (%): The percentage of the population active in the labor market.

🧠 Data Science Concepts Used

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting column names.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends over time.
Data Visualization: Creating charts to identify seasonal patterns.
Insight Generation: Understanding the socio-economic impact of unemployment.
🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for static visualizations)
Plotly (for interactive dashboards, if used)

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains unemployment records from different states in India, focusing on the fluctuations observed during the COVID-19 period.
🔗 Steps Performed
Imported necessary libraries for data manipulation and plotting.
Loaded the Unemployment dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Preprocessed the data by cleaning column names and fixing date formats.
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to find the average unemployment rate by region.
Created Visualizations (Bar charts, Heatmaps, and Time-series plots) to show trends.
Analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on employment spikes.

📈 Result

The analysis successfully identifies the regions most affected by unemployment and provides a clear visual representation of how the unemployment rate fluctuated over time, especially during the pandemic lockdowns.
